# day6

Argh, I placed 536 on the global leaderboard today but could have been so much higher because I made a silly mistake in part 2 and got locked out of resubmitting for a full minute.

I wrote:
```
        if len(set(last[-14:])) == 4:
```
instead of 
```
        if len(set(last[-14:])) == 14:
```

Gah! Lesson is to be a little more careful reading code before submitting answer, I think.
