I had a nightmare tonight - my original part 1 solution gave the correct answer for the sample input but gave the wrong answer for the real input.txt. I tried to debug it for a while but couldn't find the flaw. Decided to just start over from the start and my second try worked. Part 2 was quite easy once I had a working part one, but I went way slower than usual trying not to make a mistake again.
